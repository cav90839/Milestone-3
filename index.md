## Milestone 3: Design Alternatives

###  A. User Experience Requirements

**Decompose your proposed solution from Milestone 2 into related user stories. It is highly recommended that you organize your user stories into a hierarchy based on related activities and tasks.
EXAMPLE: As a type of user, I want some goal so that some reason.**

- As a college student, I want to be able to view my travel time between classes so that my schedule is as efficient as possible.
- As a college student, I want to make a schedule where I donâ€™t have to take the bus because the bus system is unreliable.
- As a college student, I want to know where my classes are located so I can map out how to get to them

**Which user stories are most relevant to your proposed solution and why? It could be all of them or perhaps only a few. Whatever you pick, please provide a strong justification with supporting evidence.**

**A.** The user story in which the student does not want to take the bus because the bus system is unreliable is relevant to our proposed solution because there are college students who may feel that completely avoiding the bus altogether would make their commute to classless difficult. As the bus system has been seen to make students often late to class due to students relying on it and so many students have sought out other means of reliable transportation. The articles listed below discuss some of the issues that the bus system has caused for students at UGA, as well as other 8 common ways of commuting that students have opted for. As the bus system is not required to be involved in order for students to go from one class to another.

**B.** We felt the user story in regards to a college student wanting to be able to map out where their classes are located and how to commute to them was also relevant to our proposed solution as well. As a map would make it easier for students to know their day-to-day routine for each day. It would also prove to be a reliable visual resource for helping students know their class locations and the best possible ways to reach each class in a timely manner. In the article, we listed below to support our claim, the University of Utah created a class map allowing students to map out their registered courses. The GIS team had received positive feedback such as "Others who have graduated already, who maybe went to school a few decades ago, said it so much better than anything they ever had when they were a student. They wished that they had a resource like this."

**C.** Lastly, we also felt the user story in regards to a college student wanting to be able to view their travel time between classes was also relevant to our proposed solution, and here's why: not only would this be an efficient way of communicating information in regards to commuting time between classes but it also helped combat the issue of students committing to inflexible schedules. Students would not be caught off guard or surprised by the fact that their schedule may be inconvenient because they would have this information upfront. An article that supports this evidence is this undergrad article from FSU, in which they explained how they implemented a feature that allowed students to actually schedule travel time between classes themselves. If a student were to want 30 minutes of commute time between classes, they could schedule that when registering for classes.

###  B. Ideation and Preliminary Designs

**For each of the relevant user stories you identified and justified in (A), generate numerous ideas for alternative design solutions that could be used to tell that story, then pick and describe your top two or three ideas for that story.**

**For each relevant user story, produce a low-fidelity wireframe for each top idea with enough artboards (i.e., frames, pages, screens, etc.) that a potential user might be able to provide useful feedback. Each wireframe should be presented in a way that viewers can see all artboards at once (e.g., an image with all the artboards or an embedded canvas) and individually (e.g., links to images of the individual artboards). Each wireframe should also include some justification for why some design decisions were made.**

_User Story:_ As a college student, I want to be able to view my travel time between classes so that my schedule is as efficient as possible.

**Idea A.** 
Make an option for students to type in or select the desired commute time between classes.

**Idea B.**  A warning shows if students can not get to the next class in between class times set by the university.

_User Story:_ As a college student, I want to make a schedule where I don't have to take the bus because the bus system is unreliable.

**Idea A.** 
Universities could provide alternate ways to travel for students. We designed an app with UGA as an example university that allows students to rent a scooter or bike on campus to get from one class to another.

**Idea B.** 
A taxi system is similar to uber which is free for students attending their respective universities. Students will go on the app and request a ride like the uber app. For our low fidelity, we used UGA as an example university for how the app would be designed.

_User Story:_ Make a mapping system in the registration app.

**Idea A.**
Make a mapping system in the registration app.

**Idea B.**
Add UGA maps on the poster boards around campus, showing every class building on campus so students can map out their routes as they are on the go.

###  C. Detailed Designs

**For each of the relevant user stories you identified and justified in (A), pick what you think is the best design alternative you wireframed in (B), then produce a higher fidelity mockup of the wireframe.**
